# Git Workflow Preferences

## Code Changes
- After making any code changes, ALWAYS ask the user if they want to keep the changes
- Do NOT assume changes should be kept automatically

## Git Operations
- NEVER automatically push to git
- After user confirms they want to keep changes, ask separately if they want to push to git
- Only push if explicitly confirmed by the user

## Workflow Steps
1. Make the requested changes
2. Ask: "Would you like to keep these changes?"
3. If yes, then ask: "Would you like me to push these changes to git?"
4. Only proceed with git operations after explicit confirmation
